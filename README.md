# wolfcrypt: wrapping secrets with Python

The ancient art of keeping secrets safe is nowadays one of the pillars of the internet. e-commerce, online banking, video conferences and a lot of other things are protected by encryption to become viable. Becoming fluent in basic cryptographic operations is a precious tool for any software developer.

wolfcrypt is a Python library that encapsulates wolfSSL’s wolfCrypt API. wolfCrypt is a lightweight, portable, C-language-based crypto library targeted at IoT, embedded, and RTOS environments primarily because of its size, speed, and feature set. It works seamlessly in desktop, enterprise, and cloud environments as well. It is the crypto engine behind wolfSSl’s embedded ssl library.

I will talk about classic and modern cryptography concepts a.k.a. cryptography 101 and use the wolfcrypt python module to put those concepts in practice to keep information safe.
